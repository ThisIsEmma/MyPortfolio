                        <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
                        <p>A passionate and motivated individual, I worked for over 6 years in the financial industry as an underwriter.
                            Basically, my tasks involved reviewing and approving (or declining) loan applications from individuals and companies 
                            looking to finance various assets (cars, boats, lawnmowers, you name it!)</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I always had a keen interest in computers and video games but never did anything about it 
                            (By the way, my <abbr title="Playstation Network">PSN</abbr> handle is @Sweetest_girl01 add me for some fun playing sessions !)
                            And then the pandemic hit. I lost a few family members and it prompted me to reevaluate my priorities and what I really wanted to accomplish in my life</p>
                        <p>What would be my legacy, if I was to depart prematurely ?</p>
                        <p>In January 2021, I started taking classes in software development, thus starting my journey to becoming a software engineer.
                            It has been an amazing journey so far and I am continuously growing, thanks to amazing teachers and mentors that I have found along the way.</p>
